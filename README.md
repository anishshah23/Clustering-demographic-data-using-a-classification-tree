# Clustering-demographic-data-using-a-classification-tree
Clustered the demographic data of Table 14.1 from ElemStatLearn using a classification tree. Specifically, generated a reference sample the same size as the training set, by randomly permuting the values within each feature.
Built a classification tree to the training sample (class 1) and the reference sample (class 0) and described the terminal nodes having highest estimated class 1 probability.
